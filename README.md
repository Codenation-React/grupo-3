## The problem

According to the survey, by Webshoppers (Ebit / Nielsen), Brazilian e-commerce had a turnover of approximately R\$ 53,2 billion in 2018. The _“Fashion and Accessories”_ segment represents _5,6%_ of the online retail revenue, occupying the second position among the product categories with the most orders, second only to the _electronics_ segment.

Providing the best experience to users who interact with products on the desktop, and especially on mobile devices, is essential to stay alive and competitive in this segment.

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
