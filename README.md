## The problem

According to the survey, by Webshoppers (Ebit / Nielsen), Brazilian e-commerce had a turnover of approximately R\$ 53,2 billion in 2018.

Providing the best experience to users who interact with products on the desktop, and especially on mobile devices, is essential to stay alive and competitive in this segment.

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
